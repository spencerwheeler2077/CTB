This repository is code for Christmas the Board Game Digital Version. 
I created Christmas the Board game with my sister, but only on cardboard, and
cut up paper. So after taking a GUI class I decided to try and remake our cardboard
game using python.

To run the game, clone the entire repository. I think as long as the resourse file
is found in the source file everything should work. To run the game run the file
called start. If Main is run it will start a game, but the start page won't be shown. 

Enjoy the game!
